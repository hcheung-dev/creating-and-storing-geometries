<i>Exercise 1 of Automating GIS Process 2023</i> 

## Overview
The goal of this project is to get started with GIS by creating geometries, studying their properties, and storing and retrieving them with dataframe.

The project composes of four parts:
1. create points, lines and polygons with Shapely
2. apply built-in functions to study geometric properties such as lengths, areas and centroids.
3. read and preprocess spatial data from a text file with Pandas dataframe
4. retrieve coordinates stored in the dataframe
